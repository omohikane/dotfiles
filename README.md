# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles for a customized Linux environment.

## Overview

This repository contains configuration files for various applications I use, primarily focused on a tiling window manager setup (i3/Sway) with Alacritty, Neovim, Fish shell, etc.

The configurations are managed under the `dot_config` directory, intended to be symlinked to `~/.config/`.

## Included Configurations

*   **Window Managers**:
    *   `i3/`
    *   `sway/`
    *   `kanshi/` (for display profile management with Sway)
*   **Terminal Emulator**: `alacritty/`
*   **Text Editor**: `nvim/` (Lua-based configuration)
*   **Shell**: `private_fish/` (Fish shell configurations, functions, themes)
*   **Status Bar**: `waybar/`
*   **Application Launcher**: `fuzzel/`
*   **Terminal Multiplexer**: `zellij/`
*   **Environment Variables**: `environment.d/`
